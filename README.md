# PicoIR
IR detection and generation for Raspberry Pico and other RP2040 boards

Build on top of the MicroPython language for the PIO feature in the RP2040, this project demonstrates using the state machines to detect remote control IR signals.

It includes an IR LED driver which runs concurrently and demonstrates the receive operation.
